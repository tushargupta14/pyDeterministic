\section{Deterministic Optimal Control}


\paragraph{Aim}
To find an optimal temperature trajectory, which minimizes the total volume of fine crystals, represented by the third moment of nucleated crystals ($\mu_{3}^{n}$ ) and maximizes the size of seeded crystals represented by the third moment of seeded crystals ($\mu_{3}^{s}$) in order to satisfy the product quality requirements.

\paragraph{Objective Function}
